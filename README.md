*About Me:*
Hello! I am a Computer Engineering undergrad with an interest in learning hardware and software. My topics of interest involve VLSI Design (Chip Layout, STA, Verification), PCB Design (Signal Routing, Power Analysis), Embedded Systems, and Software Engineeering. On the side, you can find me being creative in Premiere Pro/After Effects, hanging out with close friends, listening to music, or learning a new valuable skill. Feel free to take a look at my contributions/skills, and if you'd like to work with me, reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aguilar7/)!
